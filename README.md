# Chasing Pictures - Coding da Vinci 2015
This is the repository for the *back end* code for the *Chasing Pictures* project. Here, we will develop a server-side application that connects to the [front end](https://github.com/kaltsimon/Coding-da-Vinci-front-end).

## Setup
* Clone the repository
* Run `bundle install` from the project's root directory
* Run `rake db:migrate` to set up the database
* Run `rails s` to start the server
